His comorbidities include hypertension managed with oral antihypertensive drugs and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has no significant allergies and never underwent any surgical procedure. He brings an ultrasound, which shows a 4 cm heterogenous mass in segment 8. His alfafetoprotein level is elevated to 76 ng/mL. He has no symptoms and looks in good performance status. We scheduled him for a triphasic CT scan, which shows a lesion of 4.3 cm with brisk arterial contrast and venous washout. According to the LIRADS classification, this lesion could be considered a class 5 with diagnostic features of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary tumor board including hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, hepatologists, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, and interventional radiologists. The plan was to submit the patient to curative intent treatments given his early presentation according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System (BCLC), namely surgical resection or liver transplantation; radiofrequency ablation was excluded given the tumor\\u2019s dimensions. Given the good performance status, the position of the lesion (which was right below the Glissonian capsule) and the liver function of the patients, the MDT decided to schedule the patient for surgery. We therefore saw the patient in clinic and discussed the procedure. Informed consent was signed, and liver function was tested using ICG retention rate. We used 0.5 mg/Kg corresponding to 40 mg in this 80 kg patient. The DICOM data of the CT scan of the patient were then submitted to our radiologist who performed a 3D reconstruction of the patient\\u2019s anatomy and the relationship of the lesion with the major vessels.

Patient\\u2019s past medical history was unremarkable. Post-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the neck showed two lesions (kissing tumors) in the upper esophagus, causing the tracheal shift to the right side with no lymph node enlargement (Fig. ). Physical examination revealed no abnormalities, and the results of laboratory examinations were within the normal range. CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy evaluation of the mass showed a few pleomorphic spindle malignant cells among inflammatory cells in a bloody background. Additional endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum was performed for the patient, which showed a large tumor in the cricopharyngeus causing stricture, while the stomach and duodenum were normal. (Fig. ).\\nThe patient was scheduled for exploratory laparotomy with the exploration of cervical organs, resection of the pharynx, thyroid (partial), and esophagus and gastric pull up along with the insertion of a tracheostomy and bilateral chest tube, and cervical penrose.\\nThe patient was laid in a supine position. After preparation and sterilization, the abdomen was opened by a high midline incision. The surgeon inserted his finger into the mediastinum to assess the presence of any tumors. Stomach was mobilized by harmonic ligasure, lesser sac was opened, short gastric and left gastric arteries were ligated, and gastric pedicle was made on the right gastroepiploic arteries and epigastric area. Then, the esophagus was dissected bluntly by the finger in the mediastinum through the hiatus's opening and continued upward. Adhesion to the carina was found and released meticulously. Next, the collar incision was made on the neck. Then, subtotal thyroidectomy was done, and the specimen was sent for pathologic evaluation.

She had an intrauterine death at 28 weeks\\u2019 gestation.\\nOn physical examination, she presented in both lower limbs swelling. A venous color flow Doppler ultrasonography of the both lower-extremity were requested, showing bilateral venous insufficiency, but there were not peripheral venous thrombosis. On auscultation, fixed split of second heart sound and pansystolic murmur on the left side of sternal border were heard. ECG was NSR. A chest X-ray showed mild heart enlargement. Echocardiography documented enlargement of the right ventricle and both atria with atrial septal defect (approximately 33 \\u00d7 38 mm) and normal function of both ventricles (). Right-sided pulmonary veins were not identified. Multidetector Computerized Tomography (CT) angiography confirmed atrial septal defect and abnormal return of right-sided pulmonary veins into the right atrium () and showed inferior vena cava on the right side of spine and showed total interruption of IVC below the hepatic veins (). Multidetector CT angiography provided full description of a complex anomaly documenting right inferior vena cava with azygous continuation, draining into the superior vena cava (, ) and hepatic veins were draining directly into the right atrium (). Ultrasound revealed polysplenia (), 0.5 cm nodule in the left thyroid lobe and 1 cm cystic mass in the right over.\\nA standard median sternotomy was performed. The pericardial cavity was opened and the heart was exposed. SVC was dissected out to the bridging vein, exposing the azygos vein and anomalous pulmonary veins.

And what did the computed tomographic angiography show?\\nPatient's family: It showed occlusion of bilateral anterior tibial arteries and peroneal arteries, and development of collaterals.\\nDoctor: I see. Despite intensive conservative therapy including alprostadil, argatroban, and sarpogrelate, lower extremity ischemia progressed, right?\\nPatient's family: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: Alright. So, we decided to amputate her leg below the knee under general anesthesia, correct?\\nPatient's family: Yes.\\nDoctor: And her postoperative course was uneventful, right?\\nPatient's family: Yes, it was.\\nDoctor: Good. And her severe foot pain was resolved after the surgery, correct?\\nPatient's family: Yes, it was.\\nDoctor: And at the postoperative follow-up visit 3 weeks after surgery, her DHS was significantly attenuated, right?\\nPatient's family: Yes, it was. Her forward vision and neck pain were also improved.\\nDoctor: That's great to hear. The feature of the present patient was attenuation of her DHS after pain relief by amputation of her severely ischemic limb.\\nPatient's family: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: I'm sorry to inform you that your mother eventually passed away.\\nPatient's family: Thank you for your help, doctor.\\n[Conversation ends]\\n[Note: The patient eventually died.]\\n[Conversation Starts]\\nDoctor: Good morning, what brings you here today?\\nPatient's family: Our mother was referred to your department with a 1-month history of DHS.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about her history?\\nPatient's family: Yes, she had suffered from severe right foot pain because of limb ischemia related to systemic sclerosis.\\nDoctor: I see. When was she diagnosed with systemic sclerosis?\\nPatient's family: It was diagnosed 30 years ago and was classified as having limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis.\\nDoctor: Hmm, okay. And what about the fibrosis?\\nPatient's\",\n          \"Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Smith. What brings you to the ED today?\\nPatient: I was in a road traffic accident and I have severe pain in my right hip and right thigh.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you walk?\\nPatient: No, I can't.\\nDoctor: Okay. Let me have a look. Can you describe the pain you're feeling?\\nPatient: It's really bad. I can't move my right hip and thigh.\\nDoctor: Hmm, I understand. During our clinical examination, we found that you have a deformity of your right hip and thigh. Is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: And it seems that your leg and foot are showing external rotation and abduction, is that correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: There is also tenderness and abnormal mobility at your right thigh, correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: And is there tenderness at your right hip joint as well?\\nPatient: Yes, there is.\\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. We also found that the range of movements at your right hip is restricted and painful, correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: Great. And we didn't find any distal neurovascular de\\ufb01cit, correct?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: After providing advanced trauma life support, we sent you for radiography, including X-rays of your pelvis with both hips and of your right thigh with hip and knee. And we also did a CT scan of your hip and pelvis to exclude acetabulum fractures.\\nPatient: Okay.\\nDoctor: And after reviewing the radiographs, we confirmed that there was a fracture in the shaft of your femur and a posterior dislocation in your hip.\\nPatient: Oh no.\\nDoctor: Yes, I'm afraid so. We took you to an emergency OT and subjected you to closed manipulation of your hip joint. But as there was a fracture in the shaft of your femur, we were unable to reduce the hip dislocation.\\nPatient: What does that mean?\\nDoctor: It means that we had two options: open reduction and external \\ufb01xation, and closed manipulation of the dislocation of your hip joint. In the end, we placed a temporary external \\ufb01xator in your femur under anesthesia and performed closed manipulation and reduction of the dislocation of your hip using the Allis method.\\nPatient: Okay.\\nDoctor: And the day after, we subjected you to final \\ufb01xation of your femur shaft fracture in an elective OT. We fixed the fracture with a closed reduction and an internal \\ufb01xation.\\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\\nDoctor: Great. You'll need to come back for follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. And you should avoid putting weight on your right leg for the time being.\\nPatient: Okay, got it.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hi, how are you feeling today?\\nPatient: Not so good, doctor. I have been experiencing some pain and swelling in my wrist and ankle joints for the past two weeks.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\\nPatient: Sure, I have been experiencing some joint pain, swelling, and stiffness in both my wrist and ankle joints.\\nDoctor: Hmm, okay. Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?\\nPatient: Yes, I was diagnosed with lepromatous leprosy about a year ago and have been on multidrug therapy since then.\\nDoctor: I see. And you're saying that you've been experiencing these joint symptoms for the past two weeks?\\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\\nDoctor: Alright, let me take a look. [Examines patient's joint]\\nDoctor: I can see some thickening and tenderness in your tendons. But there doesn't seem to be any joint deformity.\\nPatient: Yes, I have a history of recurrent crops of tender nodular lesions during and after my therapy.\\nDoctor: I see. We did a magnetic resonance imaging on your right ankle joint to evaluate the tenosynovitis and it showed some small focal peritendinous fluid collections along the flexor digitorium longus tendon and minimal fluid around the ankle joint.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\\nDoctor: We also did a fine-needle aspiration cytology from the affected nerve and it revealed the presence of foamy macrophages and acid-fast bacilli.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that as well.\\nDoctor: The PCR from the isolates confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium leprae. So, we diagnosed you with leprosy presenting with tenosynovitis and erythema nodosum leprosum.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\\nDoctor: We started you on the standard WHO multidrug therapy for leprosy, but you didn't respond well to it. So, we gave you a combination therapy of thalidomide 200 mg per day and prednisone 50 mg per day. But even that didn't help.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\\nDoctor: That's why we started you on infliximab after doing a pre-biologic workup including chest X-Ray and viral serologies.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that too.\\nDoctor: Infliximab was given at a dose of 250 mg diluted in normal saline with dosing schedule at baseline and weeks 2 and 6. The treatment was well-tolerated and you showed good improvement in your symptoms.\\nPatient: Yes, I did feel better after taking infliximab.\\nDoctor: Great. We followed you up for 6 months and there was no recurrence of erythema nodosum leprosum.\\nPatient: That's good to hear. Thank you, doctor.\\nDoctor: No problem.

permanent sterilization. HS was performed in October 2012 under general anesthesia; pre-procedure pelvic ultrasound was unremarkable. Before HS, the patient was in good general health and all of her pregnancies were established without medical assistance. Cervical cytology was routinely normal, the patient did not smoke and she never had a miscarriage. Soon after the Essure\\u00ae devices had been placed, the patient reported gradually increasing pelvic pain, headache, dizziness, lower extremity paresthesia and fatigue. In the first six months following the Essure\\u00ae procedure, the patient registered a 20 pound weight gain. The patient\\u2019s concerns persisted over a three-year interval, although her gynecologist was disinclined to attribute any of the problems to Essure\\u00ae.\\\\nThree months after HS, the patient presented for hysterosalpingogram as recommended. While the study did confirm bilateral tubal occlusion, it also revealed an abnormal (bifid) uterine cavity. 3-D ultrasound or other imaging was not performed to clarify or refine the diagnosis of the uterine anomaly and the patient received no further counseling.\\\\nThe patient later requested surgical removal of the Essure\\u00ae implants and the possibility of device migration required evaluation (). A repeat HSG was obtained in 2015. This study revealed minimal device migration and no contrast dye spill from either Fallopian tube, a deeply bifid uterine cavity was again the most conspicuous finding ().\\\\nAt our center the patient was counseled about the atypical nature of her Essure\\u00ae placement given the anatomical abnormality of the uterus. After obtaining informed consent, the patient underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy which verified an abnormal bifid uterus (). The ostia on the right was normal as was the entire right uterine segment. However, the Essure\\u00ae device on the left partially extended into the endometrial compartment (). The exterior uterus was consistent with ESHRE Class IIb anomaly (uterine septum) (). There was no evidence of tissue perforation by either contraceptive device. Laparoscopic dissection of the left cornu and partial tubal resection bilaterally achieved complete removal of the Essure\\u00ae implants. Removal of terminal markers was confirmed. Electrocautery was maintained at 40 W power throughout the case, blood loss was estimated to be less than 50 mL. The patient was discharged three hours after surgery and her postoperative convalescence has been uneventful.\",\n          \"A 72-year-old man presented with left hip pain and intermittent low grade fever, as well as occasional yellowish drainage from a sinus tract at the surgical incision of a cementless THA performed 4 years before at another hospital. Patient's past medical history was also significant for a 2-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), performed one year prior to the current presentation. Prior use of steroids, a previous state of immunosuppression, or recent travel was not reported. The patient reported multiple prior hospital admissions due to drainage, allegedly attributed to a superficial infection and suppressed multiple times with multiple courses of per os and/or intravenous antibiotics including vancomycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole, only to recur a few months after each episode and antibiotics regimen. Anteroposterior (AP) pelvis, AP and lateral hip radiographs as well as laboratory findings were consistent with PJI, as well as heterotopic ossification adjacent to the left hip joint (Fig. ). Preoperative cultures collected with wound swabs showed Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus capitis isolates of debatable clinical significance; cultures of synovial fluid aspiration were negative. With the assumptive diagnosis of PJI and septic loosening of the implants a joint decision was obtained for a staged THA revision.\\\\nThe patient was scheduled for the first stage THA revision 4 weeks after cessation of any antibiotics. Through a posterior hip approach, the femoral component was removed via a Paprosky-style extended proximal femoral osteotomy . Next, the acetabular cup and supporting screw were removed (Fig. ). Eight tissue samples were obtained from the bone, joint capsule and femoral canal for cultures, and the implants were sent for sonication. We routinely use sonication to identify bacteria in the biofilm on explanted implants, as this method has been found to be significantly more sensitive than tissue biopsy, while maintaining almost identical specificity , . A custom-made polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) hip spacer was fashioned and placed in the femoral lumen. We used gentamicin-loaded Palacos R+G\\u00ae bone cement (Zimmer, Inc. Warsaw, IN). When using an antibiotic loaded bone cement, we routinely admixture a second antibiotic (preferably vancomycin or other based on preoperative cultures and antibiogram, if available) to increase the local concentration of antibiotics and to obtain a synergistic effect, as adding a second antibiotic seems to increase the elution of both antibiotics , . The osteotomy was repaired with cerclage wires (Fig. ). The sinus tract was resected. The patient was given 600mg of teicoplanin iv intraoperatively and was subsequently started on a standing daily dose of the same regimen.\\\\nPostoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was afebrile without any wound healing problems. Partial weight bearing with a walker was started on postoperative day two, and progressed as tolerated. Intraoperative tissue cultures were negative. Sonication of the implant at 15 days showed Pseudomonas oryzihabitans bacterial isolate (Fig. ). Based on antibiotic susceptibilities, intravenous teicoplanin 600 mg and piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g qid was administered for 3 weeks, followed by ciprofloxacin 750 mg bid and clindamicin 600 mg qid for another four weeks, aiming for a second stage revision surgery. However, because of cardiovascular comorbidities, the patient was informed for the high risk associated with a second operation and did not consent for further surgery.\\\\nAt the last follow-up, 24 months after the first stage THA revision, the patient is well, without any clinical, laboratory or imaging evidence of infection; his wound healed completely, he could ambulate with crutches for short distances with mild pain, and inflammatory markers had reduced to normal values. Radiographs of the left hip joint showed a stable PMMA spacer, without any evidence of osteolysis or loosening, and with extensive periarticular heterotopic bone formation that obviously provided for the stability of the joint (Fig. ). The patient denied further surgery and remains at close follow-up for the risk of recurrent Pseudomonas oryzihabitans infection.\",\n          \"A 32-year-old woman was admitted to the gastroenterology department for upper abdominal pain. Gastroenteritis was continually managed using omeprazole. The treatment relieved her symptoms just a little. The symptoms of upper abdominal pain appeared intermittently for about 8 months. Repeated visits to the gastroenterology department and other departments in the local hospital were made. Omeprazole treatment for gastroenteritis was continued. However, the symptoms were still not improving. Finally, the patient went to the local gastrointestinal surgery department. The abdomen computed tomography examination was performed, which revealed that thrombosis had occurred in the portal vein, superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein (Fig. ). The thrombus did not improve even after repeated visits in gastrointestinal surgery and vascular surgery. The patient was referred to the Rheumatology Department in the hospital for the aggravation of abdominal pain, involving the whole abdomen.\\\\nThe patient had two abnormal abortions in past medical history. Abnormal physical examinations included total abdominal tenderness, rebound pain and muscle tension. The patient declined for abdominal palpation. Laboratory investigations showed raised APL (anti-\\u03b22GPI 143R U/mL, ACL IgM 70 U/mL, ACL IgG 20 U/mL). Renal biochemistry, hepatobiliary biochemistry, serum lipid profile, muscular enzymes and thyroid function were normal. Computed tomography of the abdomen confirmed multiple thrombi in superior mesenteric vein and other vessels, dilatation of the small intestine and spleen infarction (Fig. ).\\\\nThe patient was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome based on clinical manifestations, past medical history and auxiliary examination results. The patient did not meet the catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) diagnostic criteria. The patient claimed a previous pregnancy loss and presented with characteristics of high-risk APL (Table ). Moreover, the patient was affected by multiple abdominal vessels and viscus. Therefore, these findings demonstrated that the patient based on the 2019 EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults, was at high risk. The patient was administered with intravenous immunoglobulin (gamma globulin 40 mg daily) and glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone 40 mg daily) to limit further disease progression. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, enoxaparin 40 mg twice a day) therapeutic dose was used for anticoagulant therapy. Abdominal pain was significantly improved after systemic treatment. The patient was discharged and put on warfarin given orally 3 mg daily, methylprednisolone 40 mg daily, and hydroxychloroquine 0.2 g twice daily to be taken with food.\\\\nAfter months of discharge, the patient was later hospitalized with recurrent abdominal pain. The patient complained about nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, no defecation, and no exhaust during the last treatment in the Rheumatology Department. The abdominal computed tomography indicated incomplete ileus (Fig. ). Gastrointestinal decompression and conservative medical treatment were performed first. However, the therapeutic effect was not satisfactory. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the department of gastrointestinal surgery for surgical treatment. As for the reasons for the patient's admission, we consider the following two aspects: First, the patient had multiple mesenteric thromboses. Although anticoagulant therapy was applied, it could only prevent new thrombosis, the existing thrombosis could not be dissolved. Also, the collateral circulation was not completely established, leading to insufficient blood supply to the intestinal tract and non-mechanical obstruction. Second, although the patient regularly took warfarin anticoagulant therapy after discharge, the drug is greatly affected by diet and inconvenient monitoring, so the INR value outside the hospital was poorly controlled.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
